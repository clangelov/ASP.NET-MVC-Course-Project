# Vinyl Community

## Project Description

**Vinyl Community** is an open-source ASP NET MVC 5 Application.

This application is design to gather at one place the people who like Vinyl Records and give them the chance to build their own community. 

Therefore the project is aimed to deliver all the latest news, information about upcoming products and the places where you can meet other people with the same interests.

The users are left with the opportunity to interact actively by leaving comments, giving ratings, to send messages to each other or just to use the chat room.

The application has:
* **public part** (accessible without authentication)
* **private part** (available for registered users)
* **administrative part** (available for administrators only)

### Public Part

The **public part** gives a lot of information to the users like almost full access the Articles and the Places sections, but still they have the incentive to register. 

### Private Part (Users only)

**Registered users** are able to add new Articles and to comment them, or to add any Upcoming Produces and give ratings to them, or the send messages to other users. 

### Administration Part

**System administrators** have administrative access to the system and permissions to administer all major information objects in the system. In this section there is a good example of using Kendo Grid UI for ASP.NET MVC
